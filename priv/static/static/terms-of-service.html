<h4>Terms of Service</h4>

<p>I'm pretty lax</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Don't be a big meanie</h4>
        <h5>Arguments are cool and all but don't resort to stuff like flamewars. No hard limits though.</h5>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Mark your lewds!</h3>
        <h5>Reminder that lewd is bad and nobody wants to be forced to see that. Just mark it sensitive and anything goes</h5>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>So I guess yeah, that's about it. Try to be nice, eh? We're probably all sad here.</p>
