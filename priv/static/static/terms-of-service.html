<h4>Terms of Service</h4>

<p>I'm pretty lax</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Don't be a big meanie</h4>
        <h5>Arguments are cool and all but don't resort to stuff like flamewars. No hard limits though.</h5>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Mark your lewds!</h3>
        <h5>Reminder that lewd is bad and nobody wants to be forced to see that. Just mark it sensitive and anything goes</h5>
    </li>
    <li>
	   <h3>Keep it legal!</h3>
	   <h5>Server is hosted in france, keep content legal for there (+ wherever you're browsing from)</h5>
    </li>
    <li>
	    <h3>No ads/spambots</h3>
	    <h5>I didn't think I'd have to specify this, but please do not set up bots solely for trying to advertise.</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
	    <h3>Non-TOS recommendations</h3>
	    <h5>This is stuff that'd I'd <em>like</em> you to do, but I won't outright ban you if you don't follow them</h5>
	    <ul>
		    <li>If someone is sadposting, don't antagonise them - they probably just want to vent</li>
		    <li>Take things as if they were posted in good faith - unless it's obvious that they weren't</li>
		    <li>Put walls of text behind a subject (CW) - helps the timeline not get flooded with text</li>
	    </ul>
    </li>

</ol>

<p>So I guess yeah, that's about it. Try to be nice, eh? We're probably all sad here.</p>
