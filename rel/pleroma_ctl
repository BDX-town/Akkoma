  echo "Usage: $(basename "$0") COMMAND [ARGS]

    The known commands are:

        create                     Create database schema (needs to be executed only once)
        migrate                    Execute database migrations (needs to be done after updates)
        rollback [VERSION]         Rollback database migrations (needs to be done before downgrading)

    and any mix tasks under Pleroma namespace, for example \`mix pleroma.user COMMAND\` is
    equivalent to \`$(basename "$0") user COMMAND\`
