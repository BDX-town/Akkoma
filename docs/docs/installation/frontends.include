#### Installing Frontends

Once your backend server is functional, you'll also want to
probably install frontends.

These are no longer bundled with the distribution and need an extra
command to install.

You **must** run frontend management tasks as the akkoma user,
the same way you downloaded the build or cloned the git repo before.
But otherwise, for most installations, the following will suffice:

=== "OTP" 
    ```sh
    ./bin/pleroma_ctl frontend install pleroma-fe --ref stable
    # and also, if desired
    ./bin/pleroma_ctl frontend install admin-fe --ref stable
    ```

=== "From Source"
    ```sh
    mix pleroma.frontend install pleroma-fe --ref stable
    mix pleroma.frontend install admin-fe --ref stable
    ```

=== "Docker"
    ```sh
    ./docker-resources/manage.sh mix pleroma.frontend install pleroma-fe --ref stable
    ./docker-resources/manage.sh mix pleroma.frontend install admin-fe --ref stable
    ```

For more customised installations, refer to [Frontend Management](../../configuration/frontend_management)
