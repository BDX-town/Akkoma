# Configuration

This file describe the configuration, it is recommended to edit the relevant *.secret.exs file instead of the others founds in the ``config`` directory.
If you run Pleroma with ``MIX_ENV=prod`` the file is ``prod.secret.exs``, otherwise it is ``dev.secret.exs``.

## Pleroma.Upload
* `uploader`: Select which `Pleroma.Uploaders` to use
* `filters`: List of `Pleroma.Upload.Filter` to use.
* `link_name`: When enabled Pleroma will add a `name` parameter to the url of the upload, for example `https://instance.tld/media/corndog.png?name=corndog.png`. This is needed to provide the correct filename in Content-Disposition headers when using filters like `Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Dedupe`
* `base_url`: The base URL to access a user-uploaded file. Useful when you want to proxy the media files via another host.
* `proxy_remote`: If you\'re using a remote uploader, Pleroma will proxy media requests instead of redirecting to it.
* `proxy_opts`: Proxy options, see `Pleroma.ReverseProxy` documentation.

Note: `strip_exif` has been replaced by `Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Mogrify`.

## Pleroma.Uploaders.Local
* `uploads`: Which directory to store the user-uploads in, relative to pleroma’s working directory

## Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Mogrify

* `args`: List of actions for the `mogrify` command like `"strip"` or `["strip", "auto-orient", {"impode", "1"}]`.

## Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Dedupe

No specific configuration.

## Pleroma.Upload.Filter.AnonymizeFilename

This filter replaces the filename (not the path) of an upload. For complete obfuscation, add
`Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Dedupe` before AnonymizeFilename.

* `text`: Text to replace filenames in links. If empty, `{random}.extension` will be used.

## Pleroma.Mailer
* `adapter`: one of the mail adapters listed in [Swoosh readme](https://github.com/swoosh/swoosh#adapters), or `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` for in-memory mailbox.
* `api_key` / `password` and / or other adapter-specific settings, per the above documentation.

An example for Sendgrid adapter:

```exs
config :pleroma, Pleroma.Mailer,
  adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Sendgrid,
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

An example for SMTP adapter:

```exs
config :pleroma, Pleroma.Mailer,
  adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP,
  relay: "smtp.gmail.com",
  username: "YOUR_USERNAME@gmail.com",
