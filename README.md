## akkoma

*a smallish microblogging platform, aka the cooler pleroma*

## About 

This is a fork of Pleroma, which is a microblogging server software that can federate (= exchange messages with) other servers that support ActivityPub. What that means is that you can host a server for yourself or your friends and stay in control of your online identity, but still exchange messages with people on larger servers. Akkoma will federate with all servers that implement ActivityPub, like Friendica, GNU Social, Hubzilla, Mastodon, Misskey, Peertube, and Pixelfed.

Akkoma is written in Elixir and uses PostgresSQL for data storage.

For clients it supports the [Mastodon client API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/guidelines/) with Pleroma extensions (see the API section on <https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/>).

## Installation

### OTP releases (Recommended)
If you are running Linux (glibc or musl) on x86, the recommended way to install Akkoma is by using OTP releases. OTP releases are as close as you can get to binary releases with Erlang/Elixir. The release is self-contained, and provides everything needed to boot it. The installation instructions are available [here](https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/installation/otp_en/).

### From Source
If your platform is not supported, or you just want to be able to edit the source code easily, you may install Akkoma from source.

- [Alpine Linux](https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/installation/alpine_linux_en/)
- [Arch Linux](https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/installation/arch_linux_en/)
- [Debian-based](https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/installation/debian_based_en/)
- [Debian-based (jp)](https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/installation/debian_based_jp/)
- [FreeBSD](https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/installation/freebsd_en/)

### Docker
While we donâ€™t provide docker files, other people have written very good ones. Take a look at <https://github.com/angristan/docker-pleroma> or <https://glitch.sh/sn0w/pleroma-docker>.

### Compilation Troubleshooting
If you ever encounter compilation issues during the updating of Akkoma, you can try these commands and see if they fix things:

- `mix deps.clean --all`
- `mix local.rebar`
- `mix local.hex`
- `rm -r _build`
