# Mangane

**Mangane** is a federated social media server with a focus on user experience.
It is based on [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/).

Pleroma is written in Elixir and uses PostgresSQL for data storage. It's efficient enough to be ran on low-power devices like Raspberry Pi (though we wouldn't recommend storing the database on the internal SD card ;) but can scale well when ran on more powerful hardware (albeit only single-node for now).

For clients it supports the [Mastodon client API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/guidelines/) with Pleroma extensions (see the API section on <https://docs-develop.pleroma.social>).

## Installation

### OTP releases (Recommended)
If you are running Linux (glibc or musl) on x86/arm, the recommended way to install Pleroma is by using OTP releases. OTP releases are as close as you can get to binary releases with Erlang/Elixir. The release is self-contained, and provides everything needed to boot it. The installation instructions are available [here](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/otp_en/).

### From Source
If your platform is not supported, or you just want to be able to edit the source code easily, you may install Pleroma from source.

- [Alpine Linux](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/alpine_linux_en/)
- [Arch Linux](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/arch_linux_en/)
- [CentOS 7](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/centos7_en/)
- [Debian-based](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/debian_based_en/)
- [Debian-based (jp)](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/debian_based_jp/)
- [FreeBSD](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/freebsd_en/)
- [Gentoo Linux](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/gentoo_en/)
- [NetBSD](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/netbsd_en/)
- [OpenBSD](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/openbsd_en/)
- [OpenBSD (fi)](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/openbsd_fi/)

### OS/Distro packages
Currently Pleroma is not packaged by any OS/Distros, but if you want to package it for one, we can guide you through the process on our [community channels](#community-channels). If you want to change default options in your Pleroma package, please **discuss it with us first**.

### Docker
While we donâ€™t provide docker files, other people have written very good ones. Take a look at <https://github.com/angristan/docker-pleroma> or <https://glitch.sh/sn0w/pleroma-docker>.

### Raspberry Pi
Community maintained Raspberry Pi image that you can flash and run Pleroma on your Raspberry Pi. Available here <https://github.com/guysoft/PleromaPi>.

### Compilation Troubleshooting
If you ever encounter compilation issues during the updating of Pleroma, you can try these commands and see if they fix things:

- `mix deps.clean --all`
- `mix local.rebar`
- `mix local.hex`
- `rm -r _build`

If you are not developing Pleroma, it is better to use the OTP release, which comes with everything precompiled.
